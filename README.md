## Websites
-----------

Website is an object representation of a real website.
A website **MUST** have a HTML content.

A website object can return useful data for SEO like:

* Website title
* Website metadata & rich contents
* Website keywords occurrences and proportions (Not implemented)
* Website location url

See ``WebsiteInterface`` for more information about it.

## SearchEngines
----------------

SearchEngine is an object representation of a real search engine.
A search engine **SHOULD USE** a scrapper to get information from internet network.

A search engine can return useful datas for SEO like:

* All websites for a needle (aka a "keyword")
* Website position in the concerned search engine for a needle
* All backlinks for a website in this search engine

See ``SearchEngineInterface`` for more information about it.

## Scrappers
------------

A scrapper is an object used to get HTML from internet network.

As this object have only 1 job to do, the only method to implement is ``get``
which accept at least 1 argument: an url location.

See ``ScrapperInterface`` and implementations in ``Adapter\Scrapper`` folder

## Crawlers
-----------

A crawler is an object used to query and manipulate HTML DOM.

Seo-core offers an interface and his Symfony2-Component based implementation.

See ``CrawlerInterface`` and implementation in ``Adapter\Crawler`` folder.

$crawler   = new SymfonyCrawler();
$scrapper = new CurlScrapper();
$googleEngine = new GoogleFranceEngine($scrapper, $crawler);

$website = $googleEngine->getWebsite('http://seo-tracker.net');

// position of website in Google
$position = $googleEngine->getPosition('seo tools online platform', $website); // 1

// metas of website
$metas = $googleEngine->getMetas();
// ['description' => 'Seo Tracker est une plateforme de suivi et d'optimisation [..]']

/**

 *         [0 => 'http://www.schema.org/CreativeWork']
 *     ,
 *     'properties' => [...]]
 * ],
 * [ 1 => [..] ]
 **/

// backlinks of website location in search engine
$backlinks = $googleEngine->getBacklinks($website);
/**
